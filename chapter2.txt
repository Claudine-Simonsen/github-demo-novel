One evening, Nick dines with a distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, in the fashionable town of East Egg. 
Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. 
The couple has recently relocated from Chicago to a mansion directly across the bay from Catsby's 
estate. There, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood
 friend of Daisy's. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who brazenly 
 telephones him at his home and who lives in the "valley of ashes", a sprawling refuse dump.[33] That 
 evening, Nick sees Catsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay.

Days later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En 
route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife Myrtle. Myrtle joins 
them, and the trio proceed to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. 
Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after 
she mentions Daisy.
